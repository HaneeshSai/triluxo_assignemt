## This is a NextJs Todo Application

Integrated with Firebase Authentication and firebase Realtime Database.

It allows users to Create an account or Login to an existing Account.

A user can add, Update or Delete their users easily and fast.

I used TailWindCSS for an easy UI and simple UI design for this Application.

I have deployed the application on netlify and here is the link for it [click me](https://triluxo-todoapp-haneeshsai.netlify.app/)

This was initially an assignment for an internship.
